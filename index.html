      <h2>Final Project: Revision and Reflection</h2>
        <p>I got feedback for this project from a family member and my boyfriend. They both agreed that the original font I thought I liked was too close together and 
          made everything harder to read, as well as the sizing of the pictures and content when I would change how big or small the screen got. So, my first change was the font. 
          Then I knew that later on I would have to make the page more responsive. I took notes on where and what areas I needed to fix and make look better. Then I just went back through 
          and really tried to get down all the CSS styling. I really liked this project. Though, it made it both easier and harder when I chose to pick my own topic. I had just finished reading 
          a book that I really enjoyed and had been waiting for. The book is called Alchemised by SinLenYu.</p>
        <p>This project was interesting to do and challenged me in so many ways. I am new to all of this so, I went out and got several books and guides for HTMl, CSS,
          and JS. I also ended up using several online pages to help me. I went line-by-line, back and forth between my monitors, from looking up chapters in my books,
          and looking up any and everything I could to make what I invisioned MY web page to be. The easiest part I think was getting to content into the html structure.
          Since we could use help to come up with the content and since I DID read the book, I knew exactly what questions or statements to put in copilot to have it 
          create the content for me. I did read all of it to make sure it was accurate, but that was the easiest part.</p>
        <p>One of the hardest things for me, personally, was what I pictured in my head and trying to excute that on github. I got very stuck on SO many things because I 
          wanted and (needed) to recreate what was in my head. I spent almost two hours one day tring to figure out one section that wasn't working, only to find it was 
          one line that was overriding another. The other hardest and most time consuming part had a lot to do with the "easiest" part. Since I was able to have the 
          content made for me I rushed getting it down in the html and didn't pay enough attention to how I was actually setting up the structure. Because of this I had to go
          back, too many times to count, and re-structure my html.</p>
        <p>CSS styling was fun and interesting. I used several web pages you gave us in your website as well as many others I found on my own. Yes, all these helped, but
          I did my own variation for each. I played with it, I got some right, and I got more wrong. I kept going through it though, until I found the right way (or changed
          the whole thing). The most help I did use was for the Javascript. We hadn't touched too much on it, but I did also go get a big Javascript book from B&N and read
          through chapters to try to understand and figure out how to execute the function I wanted. I did that for everything I put into my page. I read, watched examples,
          looked up, and played with it all to do my page.</p>
        <p>I wish I wouldn't have procrastinated this assignment. If I could start back over, I would space it out and plan alot better than I did. I hope what my page ended
          looking like is okay. I learned a lot from this class and truly enjpyed all of it. I realized I really like doing all the html, css, and JS. I like that it feels
          straight forward: you put the correct lines, data or parameters and you'll get exactly what you want from it. Thank you for your great teaching and I hope i get to 
          take another course of yours during my time at UALR.</p>

      <h2>Thoughts on Progressive Writing Enchancement</h2>
        <p>I think that the article gave a great analogy for how poeple should view building a web page. The content is really what everyone comes for, so it needs to accesible for anyone. 
          Web developer's should be staring at the base layer-the structure of the content for the web page- and then building up from that. Progressive enhancement is making sure that the content on web pages 
          are functional and accesible to everyone. My first thought about porgressive enhancement was about houses. You won't be able to suitably survive in a home for very
          long if it has a bad foundation. You may like the nice fancy kitchen and stove, but you won't like when you're having to redo your floors because the flooring
          is starting to gap and crack because of a failing foundation. The same goes for a web page. If your core structure, or foundation, is well built first, you can add the styling
          and details after.</p>
