        <h3>Helena Marino</h3>
        <p>Helena is the novel's central protagonist. She begins in a state of complete  disorientation- waking in captivity, her memories missing, her 
            identity fragmented.</p>

                            <li>Formerly a healer and alchemy student, she served the Resistance before its collapse.</li>
                            <li>At the start she is powerless (physically, mentally) and must navigate captivity, suppression of her abilities, and the trauma of 
                                war.</li>
                            <li>Her journey is one of reclaiming agency and memory: piecing together what she has lost, discovering who she is, what she did, and 
                                what she stands for.</li>
                            <li>She is morally grounded—her identity is shaped by her urge to heal, to help others—even when everything around her is collapsing.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>Because her memory is altered and missing large chunks, she is uncertain of herself. This internal conflict is key: unreliable in 
                                one</li>
                            sense (to herself), but deeply honest in another (in her responses to pain, trauma).
                            <li>Her captivity and the way others treat her (as both weapon and object) raise issues of consent, bodily autonomy, identity.</li>
                            <li>She must reconcile the part of her that was a healer with the events of the war and what she may have done or been forced to do. 
                                That tension underlies much of her development.</li>

                            <li>She is also a locus of resistance—not only against external tyranny, but against internal erasure: of memory, of identity.</li> 
                            <li>Her relationship with power is ambivalent: though once a student of alchemy (powerful), she's reduced to powerless; the arc examines
                                what happens when power is removed and regained.</li>

        <h3>Kaine Ferron</h3>
        <h4>The High Reeve</h4>
        <p>Kaine is Helena's primary interlocutor/antagonist (though the lines between those roles blur). He is powerful, feared, sealed into a role of power and 
            cruelty, yet has a complex inner life.</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <th>Key Traits and Arc</th>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>He is the High Reeve: a figure of the new regime, the enforcer, the bridge between the victors and the defeated. 
                                Helena is placed under his authority.</li>
                            <li>Yet, he is haunted by his past: his roles in war, the moral compromises he's made, perhaps even coerced into his path. 
                                Helena's perception of him gradually shifts as layers are revealed.</li>
                            <li>In his relationship with Helena there is a power imbalance, but also an emotional/psychological complexity: attraction, 
                                antagonism, negotiation of identity, trauma, and perhaps redemption.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <th>Complexities</th>
                    <td>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Kaine is not a “simple villain”: he embodies the cruelty of the system but also its victims. This duality complicates how 
                                the reader views him.</li>
                            <li>His power comes at a cost: relationally (with Helena), morally, psychologically. He may be feared by others, 
                                but internally he carries guilt, perhaps desire for change.</li>
                            <li>His dynamic with Helena forces the reader to ask: when someone commits atrocity under duress or system pressure, can they still be redeemed? 
                                What does redemption mean when so much damage has been done? (This is one of the thematic cores.)</li>

                    <ul>
                            <li>Kaine stands for the coercive power of regimes: how power corrupts, how trauma and violence reshape people.</li>
                            <li>His interactions with Helena also put into tension the ideas of captivity, complicity, complicity in one's own 
                                oppression, and the possibility of transformation.</li>
                            <li>He is part of the moral grey: this novel refuses simple black-and-white moral categories, and he is central to that refusal.</li>

        <h3>Morrough</h3>
        <h4>The High Necromancer</h4>
        <p>Morrough is the figure representing the necromantic regime, death-power, systemic corruption.</p>

                <tr>

                        <ul>
                            <li>He is an embodiment of the regime's necromantic rule: a villain not merely for personal 
                                reasons, but because he is the mechanism of oppression and death.</li>
                            <li>His power is terrifying, but the novel emphasises that the system he embodies is broader 
                                than just his person: institutions, war, ideology.</li>

                        <ul>
                            <li>While very evil in the narrative sense, the character is more effective because he is not just 
                                random evil: he's the inevitable result of war, ambition, alchemy gone wrong, and the desire to conquer 
                                death. (Indeed, the title Alchemised hints at transmutation & power.)</li>
                            <li>His role forces readers to examine the machinery of oppression: how cruelty is bureaucratised, 
                                how individuals become instruments of systemic evil, and how power structures persist.</li>
                        </ul>

                    <ul>
                            <li>Morrough symbolises death, the refusal to accept mortality, the horror of using power to overcome nature.</li>
                            <li>He is also the “other side” of Helena and Kaine's arcs: if Helena is healing, and Kaine is enforcer suffering
                                under power, then Morrough is power unmoored from care, power purely as dominion.</li>
                            <li>His presence is a reminder of how deep trauma runs and how complicit societies are in creating monsters.</li>

    <aside role="complementary">
        <div class="container">
            <article class="widget">
                <header>
                    <h2>Trauma & survival:</h2>
                </header>
                <p>Many characters are defined by what they endured. Helena's arc is trauma reshaping identity; Kaine's arc is
                 power + trauma; Lila's arc is survival + cost.</p>
                <header>
                    <h2>Memory, identity, agency:</h2>
                </header>    
                <p>What does it mean when your memory is taken, your identity fragmented? The novel explores how memory (or its absence)
                is linked to self-hood.</p>
                <header>
                    <h2>Power, oppression, complicity:</h2>
                </header>
                <p>The regime, the war, the use of necromancy/alkamy, the captor/captive relationship—these all raise 
                questions about who is responsible, who is victim, who is perpetrator.</p>
                <header>
                    <h2>Redemption & moral ambiguity:</h2>
                </header>
                <p>The characters are not strictly hero/villain; the novel explores how damaged people seek to transform, the price of change, 
                and whether one can ever fully escape past actions.</p>
                <header>
                    <h2>Love/relationship as survival, not simply romance:</h2>
                </header>
                <p>The central relationship (Helena & Kaine) is born in captivity and complexity. It's less about 
                a fairy-tale romance and more about connection forged under trauma, power imbalance, survival.</p>
