        <h2>Plot summary</h2>
        <p> Alchemised explores the story of two poeple bound by loss, obsession, and the search for meaning, set in a world where alchemy is botha science
            and a metephor for human transformation. The novel delves into the alchemy of the soul- how poeple are broken down and rebuilt through experience,
            love, and pain.</p>
        <p>The story begins in a setting where alchemy is both revered and feared, and where every act of creation requires sacrific. Both main characters are 
            driven by greif and longing, trying to relcaim something they've lost- or to turn their suffering into something beautiful. As they cross paths, their 
            relationship becomes a catalyst for change: each forces the other to confront the past, their limits, and what it truly means to be "transformed".
            Through quiet moments, moral dilemmas, and emotional intensity Alchemised explores how love, knowledge, and ambition can either purify or destroy.</p>
        <p>SenLinYu's prose is lyrical and introspective, focusing more on phsycological and emotional alchemy than on action. The result is a story that feels
            intiment, haunting, and ultimately redemptive.</p>
